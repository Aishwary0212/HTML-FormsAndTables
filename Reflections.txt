Approach:
1.I started with the registration form by adding a main heading to indicate the section's purpose.
2.I used <form> to encapsulate all input elements, ensuring that every field was labeled with <label> for better accessibility.
3.Input fields for "Full Name," "Email," and "Password" were created with placeholder text and validation attributes like required to ensure completeness.
4.Gender selection was implemented using radio buttons, and hobbies were listed as checkboxes for multiple choices.
5.A submit button was added to complete the form.
6.A separate section with a heading was created for the user data table.
7.I used <table>, <thead>, and <tbody> to organize data into rows and columns.
8.The table columns included "User ID," "Full Name," "Email," "Gender," and "Hobbies," with three rows of sample data.
9.A footer was added with my name and a copyright symbol for a professional touch.
